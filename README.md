A repository of old java code from highschool

## Okay but why?
Well, following my graduation from my highschool I figured that I should probably keep a good chunk of code that I had worked on for safekeeping. I figured it might be useful later down the line some day. I was very much correct; as a lot of these concepts that I had learnt have helped me solve problems in my current exploration of programming. While some of these required some modification to get running properly, and others are just entirely incomplete, it felt like a good idea to share this.

## General background
Its good to note that a lot of this code might seem somewhat messy. While i was tempted to just upload the original files I had realized that aside from having my real name in them they often just felt...really ugly to look at. I had to fix a lot of these in another IDE for posting. Im using IntelliJ IDEA with KOTLIN libraries if that matters. I'm not sure if it does but eh, might as well mention that. The code presents a decent analysis of each project, along with some notes about any errata and requirements for usage.
